## ‚öôÔ∏è Running locally for development

Start cloning Akuse:

```
git clone https://github.com/akuse-app/Akuse.git
```

Next, go to [this link](https://anilist.co/settings/developer) and create a new AniList API Client.
As Redirect Uri, you can insert akuse://index and it should work.
Now go inside the src/modules folder and create a clientData.js file with a structure like this:

```
module.exports = {
    clientId: ,
    redirectUri: "",
    clientSecret: ""
}
```

Fill it with the data retrieved from the creation of your AniList API Client.

```bash
# Example:
module.exports = {
    clientId: 12345,
    redirectUri: "akuse://index",
    clientSecret: "iA04TKLO3k3LaVWhxucJwck0glR6uhiv"
}
```

Next, install its dependencies (make sure npm is installed on your machine):

```
npm install
```

To start, run:

```
npm start
```

## Building for Linux

Before building for linux make sure to install dependency `libcrypt` on your system

#### Debian base systems

```shell
sudo apt install libcrypt
```

#### Fedora/RHL systems

```shell
sudo dnf install libxcrypt-compat
```

### AppImage

- use script `dist:linux` using following command

  ```shell
  npm run dist:linux AppImage
  ```

  **Note:-** AppImage Does Not Support Login reason being deeplink's not supported by AppImage

## Deb

- deb also can be build using script `dist:linux` using following command

  ```shell
  npm run dist:linux deb
  ```

  **Note:-** DEB installation should support user login after installation (not yet tested).  Raise issue if login does not work for deb installations.

## Rpm

- rpm installation can be created using dist:linux using following command

  ```shell
  npm rn dist:linux rpm
  ```

  **Note:-** RPM installation support user login. Tested on
- OS: **Fedora Workstation 39**
- DE: GNOME 45.4


## ‚ö† How to Log-In in development

In development, the Log-In redirect doesn't work since the app is not packed and the Redirect Uri doesn't find it on your machine. If you need to work with an authenticated instance, just distribute the app (```npm run dist:win``` for Windows, other scripts are in package.json file) and Log-In from there once. After that, your app will be authenticated also in development mode.

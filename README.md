## Running locally for development

Start cloning Akuse:

```
git clone https://github.com/akuse-app/Akuse.git
```

Next, go to [this link](https://anilist.co/settings/developer) and create a new AniList API Client.
As Redirect Uri, you can insert akuse://index and it should work.
Now go inside the src/modules folder and create a clientData.js file with a structure like this:

```
module.exports = {
    clientId: ,
    redirectUri: "",
    clientSecret: ""
}
```

Fill it with the data retrieved from the creation of your AniList API Client.

```bash
# Example:
module.exports = {
    clientId: 12345,
    redirectUri: "akuse://index",
    clientSecret: "iA04TKLO3k3LaVWhxucJwck0glR6uhiv"
}
```

Next, install its dependencies (make sure npm is installed on your machine):

```
npm install
```

To start, run:

```
npm start
```

## âš  How to login in development

In development, the login redirect doesn't work since the app is not packed and the Redirect Uri doesn't find it on your machine. If you need to work with an authenticated instance, just distribute the app once (```npm run dist:win``` for Windows, other scripts are in package.json file) and login from there. After that, your app will be authenticated also in development mode.

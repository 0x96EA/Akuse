## ‚öôÔ∏è Running locally for development

Start cloning Akuse:

```
git clone https://github.com/akuse-app/Akuse.git
```

Next, go to [this link](https://anilist.co/settings/developer) and create a new AniList API Client.
As Redirect Uri, you can insert akuse://index and it should work.
Now go inside the src/modules folder and create a clientData.js file with a structure like this:

```
module.exports = {
    clientId: ,
    redirectUri: "",
    clientSecret: ""
}
```

Fill it with the data retrieved from the creation of your AniList API Client.

```bash
# Example:
module.exports = {
    clientId: 12345,
    redirectUri: "akuse://index",
    clientSecret: "iA04TKLO3k3LaVWhxucJwck0glR6uhiv"
}
```

Next, install its dependencies (make sure npm is installed on your machine):

```
npm install
```

To start, run:

```
npm start
```

## Building for Linux

Before building for linux make sure to install dependency `libcrypt` on your system

#### Debian base systems

```shell
sudo apt install libcrypt
```

#### Fedora/RHL systems

```shell
sudo dnf install libxcrypt-compat
```

### AppImage

- use script `dist:linux` using following command

  ```shell
  npm run dist:linux AppImage
  ```

  **Note:-** AppImage Does Not Support Login reason being deeplink's not supported by AppImage

## Deb

- deb also can be build using script `dist:linux` using following command

  ```shell
  npm run dist:linux deb
  ```

  **Note:-** DEB installation should support user login after installation (not yet tested).  Raise issue if login does not work for deb installations.

## Rpm

- rpm installation can be created using dist:linux using following command

  ```shell
  npm run dist:linux rpm
  ```

  **Note:-** RPM installation support user login. Tested on
- OS: **Fedora Workstation 39**
- DE: GNOME 45.4

## Flatpak

- install `flatpak` && `flatpak-builder` for your operating system usign appropriate package manager.
- set appropriate `runtimeVersion` and `baseVersion` in `package.json`

  ```json
  {
  .......package.json stuff......
      "build":{
          .......other electron-builder stuff......
          "flatpak":{
              "runtimeVersion":"23.08",
             "baseVersion":"23.08"
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  **Note:-** if `runtimeVersion` and `baseVersion` are not set it will default to`20.08` which might not be installed on your system so check the version using following command and update the package.json accordingly.

  ```shell
  flatpak info runtime/org.freedesktop.Platform

  ```

  The output will look something like this

  ```
  Freedesktop Platform - Runtime platform for applications

            ID: org.freedesktop.Platform
           Ref: runtime/org.freedesktop.Platform/x86_64/23.08
          Arch: x86_64
        Branch: 23.08

        Parent: 3c58ded6fa422d45d30b070f26e428617f6e6509d18cfa1c31f959494511da66
       Subject: Export org.freedesktop.Platform
          Date: 2024-02-05 13:19:29 +0000
  ```

  specify the version `23.08` (according to above output) as `runtimeVersion` .

  check baseVersion using the following command

  ```shell
  flatpak info app/org.electronjs.Electron2.BaseApp
  ```

  if you get error something like this

  ```
  error: No remote refs found for ‚Äòapp/org.electronjs.Electron2.BaseApp/x86_64/23.08‚Äô

  ```

  this means you did not have BaseApp install it using following command
- ````shell
  flatpak install flathub app/org.electronjs.Electron2.BaseApp
  ````

  then run the previous command again to check the version and set the `baseVersion`
- At last use the following command to build the flatpak

  ```shell
  npm run dist:linux flatpak
  ```

  **Note:-** if you get any error while building flatpak run this `env DEBUG='@malept/flatpak-bundler'` command and then run above command again to see detailed logs.

## ‚ö† How to Log-In in development

In development, the Log-In redirect doesn't work since the app is not packed and the Redirect Uri doesn't find it on your machine. If you need to work with an authenticated instance, just distribute the app (```npm run dist:win``` for Windows, other scripts are in package.json file) and Log-In from there once. After that, your app will be authenticated also in development mode.

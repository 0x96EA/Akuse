## ‚öôÔ∏è Running locally for development

Start cloning Akuse:

```
git clone https://github.com/akuse-app/Akuse.git
```

Next, go to [this link](https://anilist.co/settings/developer) and create a new AniList API Client.
As Redirect Uri, you can insert `akuse://index,https://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/pin` (these are two space seprated uri) and it should work.
Now go inside the src/modules folder and create a clientData.ts file with a structure like this:

```
module.exports = {
    clientId: ,
    redirectUri: "",
    clientSecret: ""
}
```

Fill it with the data retrieved from the creation of your AniList API Client.

```bash
# Example:
module.exports = {
    clientId: 12345,
    redirectUri: "akuse://index",
    clientSecret: "iA04TKLO3k3LaVWhxucJwck0glR6uhiv"
}
```

Next, install its dependencies (make sure npm is installed on your machine):

```
npm install
```

To start, run:

```
npm start
```

## ‚ö† How to Log-In in AppImage & Development

In AppImage and in a Development environment, the Log-In redirect doesn't work since the app is not packed/installed. If you need to work with an authenticated instance, follow these steps:
1. open the app using one of the method e.g.

    ```
    npm start
    ```
      OR
    ```
    ./path/to/app.AppImage
    ```
    
2. Now click on the login button and authenticate in the browser. Next, copy the code you are given, go back to Akuse and click the navbar element with a laptop icon. Here you can paste your code.

3. Finally, paste your code and push the button. If the code you entered is correct, you are now Logged-in, othwerise repeat these steps and see what has gone wrong.

**NOTE:** This is not needed in Installed App.
